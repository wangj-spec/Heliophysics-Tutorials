# Heliophysics-Tutorials
A folder for tutorials that I am making as I come to the end of my PhD in solar physics.

This is predicated on the use of SunPy, and will be a folder of specific SunPy use cases in heliophysics that I have needed to teach / show other people.
The rate of change of heliophysics python packages is very high, in 2022 I started my PhD with many packages that are now defunct or rolled into larger packages with broader functionality (e.g. heliopy, astrospice), so these tutorials too will likely lose direct relevance in the future.
